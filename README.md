This Python script is designed to automate the transformation of fixed-position and size properties in a Dart file into dynamically responsive properties, suitable for Flutter applications.

Key Benefits

Automation: Converts hardcoded values into responsive ones without manually editing the file.
Consistency: Ensures all relevant properties are transformed systematically.
Scalability: Works across large files with multiple occurrences of left, top, width, and height.

Assumptions

The script assumes a responsive object or class with left(), top(), width(), and height() methods already exists in your Flutter project.
The paths to the input and output files (input_file and output_file) are correct and accessible.

Usage

Run this script in Python. Once processed, the output file (mainfixed.dart) will be ready for use in your Flutter project with dynamic positioning.
